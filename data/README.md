# Data Sources
For info on the data sources, see the root readme.

# Enhancements
- [] Show your work! Show the raw data and code for how it was transformed into the final.
- [] Document the data better. Sources, columns, funkiness.
- [] Fix the documented funkiness.
- [] More clearly delineate schools, parks, hospitals, etc. that are realistically out of bounds for this exercise.
- [] Include MUNI stops in the map.
- [] Currently, we are copying and pasting the data into web/public/ to be served. There should be a cleaner way to do this. Really, that data should be hosted on a CDN.

# Funky Stuff
- [] The fzp.csv file has about 320 parcels that do not exist in the SF overall parcels. Why this discrepancy? (Theory: because the parcels changed or were recombined or somesuch compared to the version the City Economist's office used.)
